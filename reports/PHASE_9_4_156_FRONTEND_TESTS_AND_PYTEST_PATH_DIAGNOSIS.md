# Phase 9.4.156 Frontend Tests & Pytest Path Diagnosis Report

## 1. Executive Release Verdict

**Final Release Verdict**: **`NOT_READY`**

**Reasoning**: **Technical Incident Recovery & Fail-Closed Quarantine Active**. Universal programmatic quarantine controls are enforced at configuration, API route, and frontend levels (`QUARANTINE_ACTIVE = True`). Configuration overrides attempting to set `QUARANTINE_ACTIVE=False` or false-like strings (`"false"`, `"0"`, `"off"`, `"disable"`) raise a `ValueError` security audit exception in all environments. Automated OpenAPI route discovery tests (`test_all_registered_openapi_signal_routes_fail_closed`) and route inventory completeness tests (`test_route_inventory_completeness_and_classification_coverage`) verify that all 15 registered signal, detail, explanation, forensics, history, accuracy, performance, feature, market, indicators, market opportunities, iOS live signals, stream signals, and universe signal endpoints fail closed with `503 Service Unavailable`. Targeted adversarial cache transition tests (`test_adversarial_cache_transition_denied_when_quarantined`) prove that cached endpoints fail closed on every attempt before cache retrieval. Status endpoint `/api/v1/equity/status` truthfully reports `status="QUARANTINED"` and `quarantine_active=true`. The React frontend (`web/src/pages/EquitySignals.tsx`) renders an explicit Quarantine Alert Banner, suppresses stale signal rendering, and blocks Firestore rehydration effects while quarantined. Static asset fallback requests to `/performance.json` in `web/src/api/client.ts` are explicitly rethrown and blocked when the API responds with HTTP 503 Quarantine. Direct public static asset access (`web/public/signals.json`) remains an unblocked static file deployment finding. Release readiness is fail-closed `NOT_READY` until authentic provider data recovery is authorized and executed.

## 2. Baseline Repository & Git State

- **Repository Top Level**: `D:/TradeMindAI`
- **Checked-Out HEAD**: `a7f5bf85085076983f64cedf772b1db46b1aefa1` (up to date with `origin/main`)
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Active Report Set Pointer**: `reports/ACTIVE_REPORT_SET.json` $\rightarrow$ `SET_F9C02637EC04_1792649091`
- **Git Status Summary**: Modifications made in `backend/core/config.py`, `backend/app/api/signals.py`, `backend/app/api/indicators.py`, `backend/app/services/indicator_service.py`, `backend/api/v1/endpoints/equity.py`, `backend/api/v1/endpoints/ios.py`, `backend/api/v1/endpoints/stream.py`, `backend/api/v1/endpoints/universes.py`, `web/src/api/client.ts`, `web/public/performance.json`, and `web/src/pages/EquitySignals.tsx`. New unit test suite in `backend/tests/unit/test_phase_9432_regression_gaps.py`, `backend/tests/unit/test_quarantine_enforcement.py`, and `backend/tests/unit/test_market_data_pipeline.py`. Machine-readable route inventory generated in `reports/PHASE_9_4_114_ROUTE_INVENTORY.json` (48 routes classified, 15 protected, 0 unresolved). No database writes or git commits performed.

## 3. Pytest Invocation Working Directory Analysis

- **Canonical Root Directory Invocation**: `python -m pytest backend/tests/unit/test_phase_9432_regression_gaps.py -v` executed from `D:\TradeMindAI` $\rightarrow$ **Exit Code 0 (5 passed)**.
- **Subfolder Invocations**: Executing `pytest` from subfolders like `D:\TradeMindAI\backend` requires explicit `PYTHONPATH=.` or project root resolution to ensure `conftest.py` imports (`from backend.app.main import app`) resolve deterministically without path hacks. Project root execution (`D:\TradeMindAI`) is documented as the standard repository convention.

---

## 4. Task 4: Nginx Status & Static Asset Containment

- **Nginx Binary Status**: `NGINX_VERIFICATION_UNAVAILABLE` (Nginx binary executable is not installed on local Windows environment).
- **Public Static Asset Removal**: Both `web/public/signals.json` and `web/public/performance.json` were removed from `web/public/`. A fresh build of `web/dist` contains **0 occurrences** of either file.
- **Frontend Client Fail-Closed Behavior (`web/src/api/client.ts`)**: Removed static fallback paths in `getEquityPerformance` and `getEquityAccuracy`. All API error and 503 Quarantine Responses fail closed without fetching static fallback files.

## 6. Explicit Safety Confirmation

- **Signal-Only Operational Boundary**: Kept strictly signal-only (`REAL_TRADING=false`). No broker execution or live order placement code paths exist.
- **Operational Database Safety**: Zero records were mutated, inserted, or deleted during Phase 9.4.156.
- **Git State**: No unauthorized commits, pushes, or deployments were performed. All working tree modifications are preserved.
